# Description

Esports players around the world, in addition to playing the game itself, often devote 
significant amounts of time to training their aim. In FPS (First-Person Shooter) games, having 
a precise aim is crucial and can distinguish a mediocre player from a high-level competitor. 
112 Aim Training adheres to the same fundamentals as other aim trainers, focusing on improving 
the playerâ€™s aim. The objective for the user is to move the mouse as quickly as possible and click 
the mouse when it hovers over a target, all while remaining stationary.

Most aim trainers on the market tend to be boring and repetitive, with targets usually being 
circles that appear and disappear at very short intervals to test reflexes and quick mouse movements. 
With 112 Aim Training, my goal is to maintain most of the original characteristics of other aim trainers 
while incorporating more entertaining elements. These enhancements include awarding points based on the 
precision of the mouse hit and introducing 3D features in the UI to make the training process more engaging. 
This approach will allow the aim trainer to more accurately simulate an actual game while preserving its 
essential training qualities.
